# MyTinyRender
A tiny soft render project following https://github.com/ssloy 's TinyRenderTutorial with additional features added.

Feature accomplished:

* Bresenham's line drawing algorithm

* Triangle rasterization

* MVP transformation

* Hidden surface removal(zbuffer)

* Phong illumination model

* Basic texture mapping(Nearest and *Bilinear interpolation)

* Guaraud shading(vertex-wise normal interpolation)

* Basic anti-aliasing(*SSAA *MSAA) The anti-aliasing effect can be reviewed in "MSAA.tga" "SSAA.tga" and "withoutAA" respectively

*means additional feature

Features plan to add:

* Phong shading(pixel-wise normal interpolation)

* Bump map and displacement map

* and more...
